# Getting started

React Native OMH Auth is a project that brings various native auth providers to React Native. It provides a single API to use different auth providers:

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, the documentation assumes you are able to create a project with React Native. If you do not meet these prerequisites, follow the links below:

[React Native - Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Additionally, the current versions of Android OMH libraries have a minimum Android API level requirement of **23**. In order for your Android application to build successfully, make sure that `minSdkVersion` is set to a value greater or equal to **23** in your [**android/build.gradle**](https://github.com/openmobilehub/react-native-omh-auth/blob/main/apps/sample-app/android/build.gradle#L4) file.

## Compatibility

| React Native | 2.0.0-beta |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| 0.73.6       | âœ…         |

## Installation

To integrate a React Native OMH Auth provider into your React Native project, you need to install the one of the available libraries:

| Provider  | Package                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Google    | `@omh/react-native-auth-google`    |
| Facebook  | `@omh/react-native-auth-facebook`  |
| Microsoft | `@omh/react-native-auth-microsoft` |
| Dropbox   | `@omh/react-native-auth-dropbox`   |

```bash
npm add @omh/react-native-auth-<provider-name>
```

## Configuring

Each plugin requires that the `@omh/react-native-auth-core` module to be manually linked inside your [**android/settings.gradle**](https://github.com/openmobilehub/react-native-omh-auth/blob/main/apps/sample-app/android/settings.gradle#L3) by adding the following line:

```gradle
rootProject.name = 'HelloWorld'
apply from: file("../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/native_modules.gradle"); applyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings)
apply from: file("../node_modules/@omh/react-native-auth-core/android/native_modules.gradle") // <- Add this line
include ':app'
includeBuild('../node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin')
```
