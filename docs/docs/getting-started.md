# Getting started

React Native OMH Auth is a project that brings various native auth providers to React Native. It provides a single API to use different auth providers:

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, the documentation assumes you are able to create a project with React Native. If you do not meet these prerequisites, follow the links below:

[React Native - Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Additionally, the current versions of Android OMH libraries have a minimum Android API level requirement of **23**. In order for your Android application to build successfully, make sure that `minSdkVersion` is set to a value greater or equal to **23** in your [**android/build.gradle**](https://github.com/openmobilehub/react-native-omh-auth/blob/main/apps/sample-app/android/build.gradle#L4) file.

## Compatibility

| React Native | 2.0.0-beta |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| 0.73.6       | âœ…         |

## Installation

To integrate a React Native OMH Auth provider into your React Native project, you need to install one of the available libraries:

| Provider  | Package                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Google    | `@omh/react-native-auth-google`    |
| Facebook  | `@omh/react-native-auth-facebook`  |
| Microsoft | `@omh/react-native-auth-microsoft` |
| Dropbox   | `@omh/react-native-auth-dropbox`   |

By running the following command:

```bash
npm add @omh/react-native-auth-<provider-name>
```

## Configuration

Each provider requires you to specify different secrets. Please follow the individual provider configuration:

- [Google](/packages/plugin-google/README.md#configuration)
- [Facebook](/packages/plugin-facebook/README.md#configuration)
- [Microsoft](/packages/plugin-microsoft/README.md#configuration)
- [Dropbox](/packages/plugin-dropbox/README.md#configuration)

## Manual linking of the core package

Each plugin requires that the `@omh/react-native-auth-core` module to be manually linked inside your Android application. Add the following line to your [**android/settings.gradle**](https://github.com/openmobilehub/react-native-omh-auth/blob/main/apps/sample-app/android/settings.gradle#L3) file:

```gradle title="android/settings.gradle" {3}
rootProject.name = 'Example'
apply from: file("../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/native_modules.gradle"); applyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings)
apply from: file("../node_modules/@omh/react-native-auth-core/android/native_modules.gradle")
include ':app'
includeBuild('../node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin')
```

## Usage

:::info

In this guide, we'll use the Google provider as an example. However, feel free to choose any other provider as the exposed methods are identical. They all inherit the [`AuthModule`](https://special-barnacle-93vn82m.pages.github.io/docs/api/classes/core_src.AuthModule#methods) from the [`@omh/react-native-auth-core`](https://github.com/openmobilehub/react-native-omh-auth/tree/main/packages/core), ensuring consistency across different providers. This means you won't need to learn any additional methods regardless of the provider you choose!

:::

### Initializing

Before interacting with a provider, initialization is necessary. Each provider requires a specific configuration to be passed as an argument.

```typescript
import GoogleAuthClient from '@omh/react-native-auth-google';

await GoogleAuthClient.initialize({scopes: ['openid', 'email', 'profile']});
```

### Sign in

Initiates the sign-in process with the provider.

```typescript
await GoogleAuthClient.signIn();
```

### Get access token

Retrieves the access token from the provider.

```typescript
const accessToken = await GoogleAuthClient.getAccessToken();
```

### Get user

Obtains user information for the current signed-in user. Returns an object of type [`OmhUserProfile`](https://github.com/openmobilehub/react-native-omh-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/types.ts#L5-L10).

```typescript
type OmhUserProfile = {
  name?: string;
  surname?: string;
  email?: string;
  profileImage?: string;
};

const user: OmhUserProfile = await GoogleAuthClient.getUser();
```

### Refresh access token

Refreshes the access token if it has expired.

```typescript
const newAccessToken = await GoogleAuthClient.refreshAccessToken();
```

### Revoke access token

Revokes the current access token.

```typescript
await GoogleAuthClient.revokeAccessToken();
```

### Sign out

Initiates the sign-out process with the provider.

```typescript
await GoogleAuthClient.signOut();
```
